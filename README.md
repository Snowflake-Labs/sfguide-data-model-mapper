## Directions
1. Run provider_init.sql in your Snowflake environment \
2. Upload files from toStage/streamlit to a "/streamlit" directory in stage dmm_data_mapper_code.content.files_v1_0 using Snowsight \
3. Upload toStage/streamlit/appPages to "/streamlit/appPages" in stage dmm_data_mapper_code.content.files_v1_0 using Snowsight \
4. Upload toStage/streamlit/Images to "/streamlit/Images" in stage dmm_data_mapper_code.content.files_v1_0 using Snowsight \
5. Run provider_sample_data_1.sql \
6. Run provider_sample_data_2.sql \
7. Run provider_app_setup.sql to finish app setup and local install \

COMING SOON - add app to listing, share with consumer, install on consumer.  Ignore provider_placeholder.sql and consumer_init.sql for now.
